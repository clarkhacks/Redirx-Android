# Redirx Android App

This is the official Android app for the Redirx project, built with React Native and Expo. Currently in an early development stage, the code is functional but still a work in progress. As a novice to Android app development and with limited recent experience in React, I appreciate your patience as the app evolves. Stay tuned for updates!

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and run the necessary commands to install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clarkhacks/Redirx-Android.git
cd Redirx-Android
npm install
```

## Using the App

1. Download Redirx from the [Google Play Store](#coming-soon) or build it yourself using [EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/apk/).
2. Share a web URL to the app for shortening and management.

## Backend Requirements

This app requires a backend server to function, powered by Firebase and Cloudflare Workers. For a step-by-step guide on how to set up the backend, check out the instructions at [Steps to Set Up the Simplified Version](https://www.clark.today/blog/redirx/#steps-to-set-up-the-simplified-version).
