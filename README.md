# Redirx Android App

This is the Android App for the Redirx project. The app is built using React Native and Expo. This is a very early development stage. The code is messy, but functional. I'm very new to making Android applications and it's been many years since I touch React. Stay tuned as this receives updates!

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
# clone command here
cd redirx-app
npm install
```

## Backend Setup

The app requires a backend server to be running. The backend server is built using Firebase and Cloudflare Workers. To build your own you can follow along at https://www.clark.today/blog/redirx/#steps-to-set-up-the-simplified-version
